# Security and Privacy for the Paranoid.  

##Beginner

* [ ] Set up 2FA on all of your accounts that support it
* [ ] Use different passwords for all of your accounts
* [ ] Use a password manager like 1Password or LastPass. Change the master password periodically.
* [ ] Delete your unused and unnecessary accounts
* [ ] Set strict privacy options on Facebook (see below)
* [ ] Set strict privacy options on Google (see below)
* [ ] Set up login notifications on apps that allow it
* [ ] Use Privacy.com when doing online transactions and enable transaction notifications
* [ ] On services that allow it, check for active sessions, and delete any unused, forgotten, or unapproved sessions
* [ ] Secure your Skype account if you need/use it. Delete it if you don't. (I've never seen any kind of account get hacked as many times as my friends' Skype accounts. Everyday there's some baidu link coming my way. Could just be my social circle though)
* [ ] Disable paper bank statement mailings
* [ ] Delete your Yahoo account. If you need it for Flickr, set a long password, set up 2FA, and enable login notifications
* [ ] Stop oversharing on social media - no one cares, sorry


##Advanced
* [ ] Set cookies, history, etc to delete after 30 days (or less!)
* [ ] Don't use unsecured wifi networks without a VPN
* [ ] Install VyprVPN on your computer (or another VPN client)
* [ ] Install Malwarebyte on your computer
* [ ] Use encrypted communication methods - Signal, etc.
* [ ] Make sure that any device or app you store sensitive info in is encrypted. (Evernote, Day One, etc - BTW, Day One isn't encrypted)


##Device Settings
On Your Phone

* [ ] Disable TouchID / fingerprint unlock
* [ ] Set a passcode / password of 6+ characters
* [ ] Disable what someone can see/do with your phone if they don't have the password (lock screen widgets, notification privacy, Apple/Android/Samsung Pay)
* [ ] Disable location services for any app that doesn't really need it. Disable "always on" location services from literally everything.

On Your Computer

* [ ] Turn on Firewall on your Mac
* [ ] Cover your computer webcam with a Post-it
* [ ] Set Mac lockscreen notifications to private
* [ ] For the super-paranoid, not tied to Mac or Windows: use QUBES OS or Tails OS
* [ ] Get rid of your Android and get an iPhone (not intentionally pretentious, && there are great iPhones at basically any price point these days)

Other

* [ ] Get rid of your Amazon Alexa and Google Home


##Offline

* [ ] Consolidate external hard drives and USB thumbdrives so you don't lose them
